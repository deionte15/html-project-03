    <p>If you're a fan of comic books or the hit Marvel superhero movies, you'll <br>
      love Marvel Contest of Champions. This one-on-one fighting game is <br>
      extremely simple, but also fast-paced and fun. Warm up your tapping fingers!</p><br>

  <h2>Minecraft Pocket Edition</h2>

    <p>It would be difficult to understate the importance of Minecraft in the <br>
      world of gaming today, and you can get a taste of that experience on <br>
      your phone in Minecraft Pocket Edition. Think of it as a cubist <br>
      terrarium in which you can mine, craft, and construct to your <br>
      heart's content. It's surprisingly compelling, even for hardcore <br>
      fans of the original desktop Minecraft.</p><br>

  <h2>Monument Valley </h2>

    <p>Monument Valley is an incredibly beautiful game, proving that<br>
      mobile game doesn't need to be synonymous with cheap and shallow.<br>
      In this meditative puzzler, you'll have to use optical illusions<br>
      to complete each gorgeous level. Meditative, mysterious, and<br>
      intriguing, it's a must-play Android game.</p> <br>

  <h2>Ridiculous Fishing </h2>

    <p>Try to hook as many deep-sea fish as you can before they're<br>
      all tossed in the air. Then throw aside your rod and reel<br>
      and pull out your...minigun? The madness doesn't stop<br>
      there in this hilarious, bizarre game. This is truly <br>
      ridiculous fishing.</p> <br>

  <h2>The Simpsons: Tapped Out</h2>

    <img src="http://cdn2.stevivor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/whackingday.jpg">

    <p>Far from being a dreary cash-in, Tapped Out is a<br>
    brilliant, satirical look at casual gaming and even<br>
    the long-running cartoon which spawned it. Yes, it's<br>
    packed with opportunities to spend real money, but<br>
    it's always with a wink and a nudge. The best parts<br>
    of this game are easily the massive events that<br>
    completely re-skin Springfield and its denizens.<br>
    You'll wear out the screen with all your tapping.</p> <br>

  <h2>Spaceteam </h2>

    <img src="https://latimesherocomplex.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/spaceteam6.gif?w=600&h=300">

    <p>Set Lustrous Prismneck to Maximum! In<br>
    Spaceteam, you and the other people in the<br>
    room work together to navigate a spacecraft<br>
    through various mechanical disasters. If<br>
    you love the techno-babble of Star Trek,<br>
    then you'll love this unique game.</p> <br>

  <h2>Star Realms </h2>

    <img src="http://www.coliseumofcomics.com/titus/games/titus_games_starrealmsleague.jpg">

    <p>This clever sci-fi card game has<br>
    surprising depth despite being easy<br>
    to learn and fast to play. Assemble<br>
    your fleet, and then use your ships<br>
    and bases to pummel the enemy into<br>
    submission. If you enjoy deck<br>
    building games like Dominion,<br>
    then you'll feel right at home.</p> <br>

  <h2>Survive! Mola Mola! </h2>

    <img src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/FDvU-9tOztk/maxresdefault.jpg">

    <p>One of the strangest games to arrive on our phones, <br>
    Survive! Mola Mola! is a sunfish simulator based on <br>
    the (scientifically dubious) idea that these animals are <br>
    the dumbest and weakest of all living things. <br>
    Basically, it's a virtual pet, but one <br>
    that's more likely to kill itself by <br>
    jumping too high out of the water.</p><br>

  <h2>Trivia Crack</h2>

    <img src="http://bleevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/trivia-crack.jpg">

    <p>Play against your friends (or enemies) with the game that blatantly flaunts<br>
    its addictive properties in the title. Answer multiple-choice questions in<br>
    the areas of Science, Entertainment, Art, Geography, Sports, and History.<br>
    Be horribly embarrassed when you fail.</p><br>

  <h2>TwoDots</h2>

    <img src="http://mgclick.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/f81d6ce0-5a03-4f7c-a4ff-ad00c85d09aa.png">

    <p>If you enjoyed the minimalist beauty of Dots, then you'll love its<br>
    sequel: Two Dots. As in the original, you're tasked with connecting<br>
    dots of like color, but now there are new challenges and an even<br>
    lovelier aesthetic.</p><br>
